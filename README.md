# Eh-I-Don-t-Know-What-to-Eat
Random food generator for those who can't choose what to eat
Utilizes text files to generate the choices. 
I may create a version that searches the web for food options and recipes sometime in the future. 
As for now, there are two versions. The first one is a simple one that lists out fast food options for dinner. The second one is a notch up that has different meal options and it gives the user the choice if they want to make something or eat-out. These two versions are rather simple because they were for my C++ Objects class.
To change the food options, just change the txt files. Make sure to update the number of options though
